/**
 * The single home for the video library's URL parameter vocabulary.
 *
 * The URL is canonical. `state/filters.svelte.ts` derives live filters from it
 * for every consumer that reads them — the browse bar, infinite grid,
 * advanced-search panel, chips and Pagination — and the advanced-search
 * panel's rerun writes back through serialiseFilters. One parser and one
 * serialiser keep those consumers from drifting apart.
 *
 * URL names are `q, pg, perpage, sort, from, to, presenter_id, event`.
 * The names on BrowseFilters are the app-facing ones.
 *
 * This vocabulary is exhaustive: a round trip through
 * parseFilters/serialiseFilters **drops every other query param**, including
 * `utm_*`. That is deliberate — the URL is the filter state — but it means
 * anything that needs to survive a filter change has to be added here.
